Be default, Blesta is installed without the ability to access the Blesta API, even if you have a user account that has API Access granted to it.  To open up access, you have two options, please follow the easiest option for you.

### API Access Key

If your site is cloud based (ie the IP floats) or you change your IP address alot (for some other reason) then you will want to setup the API Access Key.  To do this, follow these steps:

Follow Instructions in Blesta's Docs: [https://docs.blesta.com/display/user/System+%3E+API+Access](https://docs.blesta.com/display/user/System+%3E+API+Access)

You have now added an Access Key to your Blesta configuration file.  For more information on adding an access key, please consult [https://docs.blesta.com/display/user/System+%3E+API+Access](https://docs.blesta.com/display/user/System+%3E+API+Access)
