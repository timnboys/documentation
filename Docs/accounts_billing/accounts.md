Our site is utilizing a number of applications to provide you with the best resources and provide a consistent user experience.  Here are some questions and issues that we have been asked.

## Registration

### How do I register?

To register on our site, please click on the green button at the top right that reads *Create An Account*.  Be sure to complete the form accurately and in it's entirety.

### Your site won't permit me to use my email address.  Why?

In order to cut down on fraud and abuse, we run automated fraud checks on every registration to reduce and cut down on any fraud and abuse before it happens.

### Your registration form indicates my email is in use.  Why?

You may already have an account on our system.  Please use the *Forgot Password* link from our login screen to reset your password.


## Logging In

### Why am I able to log in but not open a ticket?

Support ticket access requires a current *Support and Update Pack* on your product license.  Please be sure your license is up to date and proceed.

### What is my username?

Our system supports both a traditional username and an email address as the username.  If you don't know your username, or haven't set it yet, please use your email address.

### Why can I see my billing details but at the top of the site indicates I'm not logged in?

This may happen if you were logged into our site but subsequently navigated away or left your session running and have come back.  To ensure you are logged in completely, please close your browser and reload our site, logging in from the Login button at the top right.
