Licensing
==================

### Can I install on an unlimited number of sites?

Our products that utilize Blesta are licensed in a way to provide installation for each license in one location.  Each license is bound to the domain name, the IP address as well as the path that your Blesta is installed at.

### I just changed servers and my product is not working!

Since our licenses are bound to the IP address of your server, you will need to reissue your license in order for the new location to be bound to it.  To do this, log into our site, then click on *My Products* on the right side, find your product license, click on the *View Details* of the product and press the *Reissue* button at the bottom.  Now go into your Blesta' product licensing area and hit *Submit*.  This should result in your license being rebound to the new location. 

### My server's IP address changes, what can I do?

If you ip floats, and changes often, we recommend setting up someway to ensure ip's stay the same for licensing purposes.

### Isn't the product proprietary ?

The CMS/Blesta components, modules and plugins we offer with our products are always proprietary, and are encoded with ioncube to protect our Intellectual Property(IP)
