Support & Upgrades
==================

### What is a Support and Upgrade Pack?

A Support and Upgrade Pack is attached to our purchased (owned) licenses and is a renewable service that gives you access to the latest product downloads and quality support services.  Renewing your Support and Upgrade Pack is not required, but it is a good idea to keep your product up to date.

### How long is a Support and Upgrade Pack valid?

A Support and Upgrade Pack is valid for one year from the time of purchase.  Our purchased products include the Support and Upgrade Pack for the first year.

### What is included in a Support and Upgrade Pack?

The Support and Upgrade Pack provides you access to our latest product downloads to ensure your product is up to date to keep pace with changes in Joomla, WHMCS and changes to server environments.  The Support and Upgrade Pack also provides access to our support forum and our ticket system to ensure support services are always available to you.

### What happens if I allow it to expire?

If the Support and Upgrade Pack on your license expires, you can certainly continue using your product beyond the expiration date.  There is no penalty for not renewing the pack.  If you were to download and install a release of our product that is made available after the expiration date of your Support and Upgrade Pack, the product will stop working and you will need to either revert to the older product or renew your Support and Upgrade Pack.

### How do I renew or reorder?

To renew or reorder a Support and Upgrade Pack, be sure to log into our site using the green 'Login' button above.  Once logged in, on the menu to the right you will see *Available Addons*.  Click that link and you will be able to select the product and pack you need to get up and running once again.
