Your Download ID is used in order to utilize the automatic updates that are available in most of our products.  This makes upgrades much simpler to perform.

### About the Download ID

#### What your Download ID is NOT

When you purchased a product from us, you should have received an email containing your License Key.  This is NOT your Download ID.  Entering this value in our products for the Download ID will not result in the ability to download or perform upgrades.

#### Your Download ID changes with your password

If you change your password on our site, even if you reset it to be the same as it was previously, the Download ID is changed.  This is because the Download ID is generated based solely on your password hash in our database.  When that hash changes, the generated code changes and the previous code will not be able to be found when attempting to download software updates.

#### You must have a valid Support and Upgrade Pack

If you have your Download ID in place but your Support and Upgrade Pack is NOT current with us, you will not have access to the latest downloads.  This is because access to the downloads are managed by the status of the Support and Upgrade Pack.  If you have your Download ID but are still unable to download the latest update, please be sure your Support and Upgrade Pack is not suspended or terminated, if it is, you will need to either renew it or purchase a new pack for your license.
