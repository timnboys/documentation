Following an upgrade to Blesta, some template files may change.  When this happens, C!Blesta must be told to correct them.  If you do not correct them, then the site will appear to be broken, perhaps with text all over the place, menu items not looking correct and styles bleeding over incorrectly.

If your C!Blesta was working fine prior to a Blesta upgrade, but now the integration is broken or distorted looking, follow these steps:

1. Log into the administrative back end of your Blesta application using an account with access to the C!Blesta plugin.
2. Navigate to Settings > Installed Plugins and select Manage next to C!Blesta
3. Click on the System Check button located just beneath the C!Blesta logo.
4. For each of the Red "Fix" buttons, click on them.
5. View the front end of your site, it should look correct now.
