### Welcome

On behalf of the CubeData Team, I'd like to say thank you for purchasing C!Blesta, and welcome to the CubeData product family!

We strive to provide the best possible products, services and support to meet your every integration need, and C!Blesta certainly plays a key role in that effort.  We hope you find the product and this documentation useful and informative, and we hope it makes your integration and site management easier and more professional.

#### Requirements

The following software requirements must be met for J!Blesta to operate:

* PHP 5.3+
* MySQL 5+
* ModX or Concrete5 latest versions+
* Blesta 4.0+
* Dunamis Framework 1.3+

Older versions of MODX/Concrete5! or Blesta may work, however they cannot be supported and should be upgraded to ensure proper functionality (as well as security and other considerations).  MODX/Concrete5! version 1.5 is not supported.

#### Considerations

If you are using a server level firewall such as mod_security then you should consider whitelisting your servers IP address. The product will necessarily communicate to your server through CURL and may get blacklisted if your security rules are too stringent. A clear indicator of a firewall issue is a '0' response being received by the API handler. This is unrelated to C!Blesta, but rather is a server configuration issue entirely. Please consult your hosting provider for more information on resolving this issue.

### Key Concepts

When dealing with C!Blesta there are some key concepts to keep in mind in order to understand exactly what the product does.

#### Visual Integration

The visual integration refers to wrapping your MODX/Concrete5! site around your Blesta content.  This is accomplished by utilizing the event calls built into Blesta to fetch the MODX/Concrete5! site and perform a number of regular expression matches upon the returned content.  These regular expressions do everything from changing the href links to changing image locations.

#### User Integration

The user integration refers only to the bridging of user accounts between MODX/Concrete5! and Blesta.  Like visual integration, the user integration is accomplished by utilizing the built the event calls built into Blesta as well as the user level plugin in MODX/Concrete5!.  The User Plugin also manages the insertion of additional fields into the registration form for MODX/Concrete5!.

### Installation

Please follow these simple steps in order to install the product into your MODX/Concrete5! and Blesta sites:

The C!Blesta has settings on both ModX/Concrete5! and Blesta that permit management of the product for each system.
