The Blesta addon module for C!Blesta requires a current license to function.

### License Types

CubeData provides three types of licenses for the C!Blesta product line with the following limitations and restrictions:

1. *Owned License*<br />
A owned license is yours in perpetuity.  Newly purchased licenses include support and upgrades for one year after which point support and upgrade may be purchased or renewed.  Any version of C!Blesta released AFTER the expiration of your support and upgrade pack will result in product failure so be sure to only upgrade products directly from CubeData.
2. *Leased License*<br />
A leased license is valid on a month to month basis.  Support and upgrades are always included in a leased license.
3. *Development License*<br />
A development license is only available to owned license holders, and one is included free upon request for any current license holder.  Development licenses are intended to be used only behind a firewalled or protected location that prevents access to the general public.  Multiple development licenses may be purchased at additional cost.
